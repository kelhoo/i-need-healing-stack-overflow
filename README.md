# Insights from Stack Overflow Survey
We've taken the latest Stack Overflow Survey and have selected some results to display that we believe would benefit people who are interested in pursuing a programming career.

## Areas of Focus
The first tab displays interactive graphs that display the profession, education level and majors that people have taken.

The second tab focuses on jobs and job satisfaction, as well as how that ties to the major that surveyors have pursued.

The third tab displays common sets of languages people know, as well as the various company sizes that people who have taken the survey currently work with.
